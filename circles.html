            <h1>Composeo</h1>
            <p>Composeo started as a partnership between ENSEIRB-MATMECA (my engineering
            school at the time) and Sopra-Group. It aimed at creating a clone of Netvibes
            or iGoogle (in a nutshell, personal page with tabs and widgets) that companies
            could install as their intranet interface. It would allow them to code widgets
            with confidential data without having to send these data to an untrusted
            third-party.</p>
            <p>We were a team of 6 during one semester and 12 during another semester.</p>
            <p>The project was discontinued and sources are not available, but it was my
            first by web project and I learned a lot in reproducing more or less Netvibes.</p>

            <p>This project is not mature yet. It aims at writing a crawler (in JavaScript 
            using Node.js) with the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Target some informations in a web page
                <li>Report broken URLs

                <li>Good HTTP support (GET, form submission emulation (POST+data), cookies...)

            <h1>JavaScript company training</h1>
            <p>I have given a 2-day JavaScript company training/workshop at
            <a href="http://www.4sh.fr/">4SH</a>. First day was dedicated to language basics
            following the plan in a 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript_technologies_overview">documentation page I wrote earlier.</a>
            The second day was dedicated to a code review of their own code they had sent me
            beforehand in the morning and to practial exercices in the afternoon.

            <h1>JavaScript Object Visualisation tool</h1>
            <p>In order to explain how JavaScript object works (properties, inheritance)
            during the aforementionned company training, I wrote a
            <a href="http://davidbruant.github.com/ObjectViz/">little tool which
            visualizes objects</a> using <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphael.js</a>.

            <h1>Ludesik</h1>
            <p>Ludesik is a project I have been working on with friends of mine,
            <a href="https://twitter.com/damienriccio">Damien Riccio</a> (architecture, code)
            and <a href="https://twitter.com/epilepticrabbit">Laura Hilliger</a> (design).
            The goal was to code an HTML/CSS/JavaScript equivalent to
            <a href="http://www.earslap.com/projectslab/otomata">Otomata</a>.
            <a href="https://github.com/driccio/Ludesik">Code is available on Github</a>. The project
            is stable but still has a couple of bug. A working demo can be downloaded anyway from Github.</p>

            <p>Just made for the purpose of this application. The goal was to reproduce one of the
            wheels that can be found on <a href="http://www.dijiwan.com/accueil/">Dijiwan page</a>
            in pure HTML and CSS. It uses recent technologies, so it is obviously not cross-browser.</p>

            <h1>Open web technologies documentation</h1>
            <p>For more than a year, I have been contributing to the documentation
            on the Mozilla Developer Network, mostly on JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>I have participated to every single "doc sprint" organised by Mozilla, from the
            <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/10/web-standards-doc-sprint-finis/">first one</a>
            to the
            <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/10/jsconf-eu-doc-sprint-results/">latest in Berlin at JSConf.eu.</a>
            </p>
            <p>My work (pages I have highly improved as well as my TODO list) can be followed
            on my <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/User:dbruant?view=home">user page</a>.</p>

            mailing-list discussing the next version of ECMAScript (JavaScript standard). I have mostly provided
            feedback on 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy">Harmony proxies</a>,
            feedback which has
            <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?do=search&id=bruant">influenced the design of this feature</a>.</p>
